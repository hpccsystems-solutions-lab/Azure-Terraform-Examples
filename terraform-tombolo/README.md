This repository contains Terraform code to setup Azure Paas/IaaS services for deploying a Client/Server application ([Tombolo](https://github.com/hpcc-systems/Tombolo)). The application uses ReactJS for the client and ExpressJS/NodeJS for the backend

Some of the Azure services used in this example so far are:

* App Services

* Azure MySQL

* Application Gateway

* Private Endpoints

* Virtual Network

**Please note that, this is an ongoing work and this repository will be constantly updated based on the progress**
